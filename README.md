# Alten Playground - Deep Learning

## Exercise 1 - Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning
In this hands-on exercise we are going to learn to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits.

## Exercise 3 - Building auto-encoders in Keras
In the exercise, we show how to build auto-encoders in Keras, which can be used to compress images and remove noise.
